    "## Federated learning in TinyML\n",
    "\n",
    "TinyML combines ML, mathematical optimization and tiny IoT embedded systems. TinyML is an effective method to analyze real-world data continuously, without the resource overhead of traditional ML hardware. [TinyFedTL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9767250) is the first open-sources implementation of federated learning (FL) in IoT containing microcontroller unit (MCU) and small CPU based devices. TinyFedTL uses transfer learning (TL) to demonstrate effective privacy-centric FL on devices with a small memory footprint (less than 1 MB). Researchers and engineers may open up data in various fields to gain insights for improving life quality or user experience without sacrificing privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "While recent progress in ML frameworks has made it possible to perform inference with models using cheap, tiny devices, the training of the models is typically done separately on powerful computers. This provides the training process abundant CPU and memory resources to process large stored datasets. However, it is possible to train the machine learning model directly on the microcontroller and extend the training process with federated learning. [On-device training](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/4/573) has been illustrated with keyword spotting task. Experiments were conducted with real devices to characterize the learning behaviour and resource consumption for various hyperparameters and federated learning configurations. The observation was, that when training locally with fewer data, more frequent federated learning rounds reduced the training loss faster, but with the cost of higher bandwidth usage and longer training time. The results indicated that depending of the application, the trade-off between the requirements and the resource usage of the system needs to be determined.\n",
