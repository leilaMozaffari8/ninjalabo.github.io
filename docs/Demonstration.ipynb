    "\n",
    "These can all easily be started with the help of docker using the [docker-compose-with-bridge.yml](https://github.com/TinyMLaas/TinyMLaaS/blob/main/docker-compose-with-bridge.yml) file in the [Main repository](https://github.com/TinyMLaas/TinyMLaaS). The application can be started with\n",

    "The first thing that should be done on the *Device* page is to either add a new bridge or selecting an existing bridge. Let's add the bridge that was started by docker compose. To do that, add the name of the bridge docker container with the port 8080 as the bridges address. The bridge will also not use a HTTPS connection in this case.\n",

    "Selecting a device to which to install the trained machine learning model later on is required. If the wanted device has not been registered already, register it either manually or by selecting it from the list of devices connected to the bridge.

    "Let's train a new model. For this, we first need to decide the parameters with which to train the model with. This time we chose to train the model with 27 epochs and with a batch size of 56.

The C array is the tflite model turned into bytes stored in a C array, which is required for embedded devices, which do not have a filesystem.\n",
