    "section": "The Need for AI Compression",
    "text": "The Need for AI Compression\nAI models, especially deep learning networks, have become increasingly complex and resource-intensive. Traditional deployment of these models on edge devices, such as smartphones, IoT sensors, and embedded systems, poses significant challenges due to limited computational power, memory, and energy resources. AI compression techniques, including model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, aim to reduce the size and computational requirements of AI models without significantly compromising their performance."
